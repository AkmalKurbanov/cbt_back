<p>“Community based” means supporting products, services, knowledge and practices found in local communities and offered by local stakeholders. The following definition is used by the World-wide Fund for Nature (WWF):</p>

<p>“<em>Community Based Tourism is a form of tourism where the local community has a substantial control over and involvement in its development and management; and a major proportion of the benefits remain within the community</em>”.</p>

<p><em>Community based tourism</em> (CBT) is the practice of providing natural, value-packed travel services that utilize local accommodation, food, music, art, crafts and traditions. CBT supports rational and sustainable development. CBT gives travelers authentic visits inside homes, villages and heritages while delivering proceeds directly to the families that visitors stay with and buy from.</p>

<p>Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing of all industries globally. But despite the industry’s enormity and pattern growth, everyday tourism destination citizens have commonly found themselves left out of the decision-making and investment process. As a result, in all too many places among Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, unsustainable tourism has degraded communities, increased crime, damaged natural resources, ruined artifacts and destroyed sites of heritage. CBT shifts the paradigm from focusing on aggregate “growth” to include participatory stakeholder decision-making, investment opportunity for traditionally local inhabitants and sustainable environmental practices. Thus, CBT is used to describe a variety of activities that encourage and support a wide range of objectives in economic and social development and conservation.</p>
